# README: Introduction to Application Development with Java

Throughout this course, I explored writing Java code in a logical, structured, and organized manner. I mastered key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) and develop skills in creating, reviewing, and documenting interactive applications using Software Development Kits (SDKs) and Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tools.

## Objectives

- **Problem-Solving**: Apply programming to solve business and engineering challenges.
  
- **Object Orientation**: Master OOP principles for efficient code design.
  
- **Interactive Applications**: Develop user-friendly applications with input handling.
  
- **Tool Proficiency**: Use SDKs and IDE tools effectively for productivity.

## Learning Outcomes

- Write well-structured Java code.
- Implement OOP concepts like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Create interactive applications with user interfaces.
- Utilize SDKs and IDEs to streamline development.
